## Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown Presentation & Plotly
Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. 
Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r}
library(plotly)
```


```{R}
data(iris)

plot_ly(x= iris$Sepal.Width, y= iris$Sepal.Length, z = iris$Species, 
type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers", color = iris$Species)
```
